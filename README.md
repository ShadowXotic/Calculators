## Basic Operations
The basic calculator supports the following operations:

1. **Addition (a)**
   - Adds two numbers.
   - **Example**: `5 + 3 = 8`

2. **Subtraction (s)**
   - Subtracts the second number from the first number.
   - **Example**: `5 - 3 = 2`

3. **Multiplication (m)**
   - Multiplies two numbers.
   - **Example**: `5 * 3 = 15`

4. **Division (d)**
   - Divides the first number by the second number.
   - **Example**: `6 / 3 = 2`
   - **Note**: Division by zero is not allowed.

### How to Use Basic Operations
1. Choose the basic calculator by typing `1` when prompted.
2. Enter the operation (a, s, m, d).
3. Enter the first number.
4. Enter the second number.
5. The result will be displayed.

## Advanced Operations
The advanced calculator supports additional operations:

1. **Square**
   - Squares a number.
   - **Example**: `4^2 = 16`

2. **Cube**
   - Cubes a number.
   - **Example**: `3^3 = 27`

3. **Power**
   - Raises the first number to the power of the second number.
   - **Example**: `2^3 = 8`

4. **Square Root (sqrt)**
   - Calculates the square root of a number.
   - **Example**: `sqrt(16) = 4`

5. **Cube Root (cbrt)**
   - Calculates the cube root of a number.
   - **Example**: `cbrt(27) = 3`

6. **Custom Root (root)**
   - Calculates the nth root of a number.
   - **Example**: `8^(1/3) = 2` (cube root)

### How to Use Advanced Operations
1. Choose the advanced calculator by typing `2` when prompted.
2. Enter the operation (square, cube, power, sqrt, cbrt, root).
3. Enter the first number (type `0` for square, cube, sqrt, cbrt, or custom root).
4. Enter the second number.
5. The result will be displayed.

## Trigonometric Functions
The advanced calculator supports trigonometric functions:

1. **Sine (sin)**
   - Calculates the sine of an angle (in degrees).
   - **Example**: `sin(30) = 0.5`

2. **Cosine (cos)**
   - Calculates the cosine of an angle (in degrees).
   - **Example**: `cos(60) = 0.5`

3. **Tangent (tan)**
   - Calculates the tangent of an angle (in degrees).
   - **Example**: `tan(45) = 1`

### How to Use Trigonometric Functions
1. Choose the advanced calculator by typing `2` when prompted.
2. Enter the operation (sin, cos, tan).
3. Enter the first number (type `0` for trigonometric functions).
4. Enter the angle in degrees.
5. The result will be displayed.

## Logarithmic Functions
The advanced calculator supports logarithmic functions:

1. **Logarithm (log)**
   - Calculates the base-10 logarithm of a number.
   - **Example**: `log(100) = 2`

2. **Natural Logarithm (ln)**
   - Calculates the natural logarithm of a number.
   - **Example**: `ln(2.718) â‰ˆ 1`

### How to Use Logarithmic Functions
1. Choose the advanced calculator by typing `2` when prompted.
2. Enter the operation (log, ln).
3. Enter the first number (type `0` for logarithmic functions).
4. Enter the number.
5. The result will be displayed.

## Special Math Lessons
### Basic Arithmetic
- **Addition**: Combining two or more quantities.
- **Subtraction**: Finding the difference between two quantities.
- **Multiplication**: Repeated addition of the same number.
- **Division**: Splitting a number into equal parts.

### Exponents and Roots
- **Exponentiation**: Raising a number to a power.
- **Square Root**: Finding a number that, when multiplied by itself, gives the original number.
- **Cube Root**: Finding a number that, when cubed, gives the original number.

### Trigonometry
- **Sine, Cosine, Tangent**: Functions that relate the angles of a triangle to the lengths of its sides.

### Logarithms
- **Logarithm**: The exponent by which a base number must be raised to produce a given number.
- **Natural Logarithm**: Logarithm with base `e` (Euler's number).
