    - Special Math Lessons

    ## Basic Operations
    The basic calculator supports the following operations:

    1. **Addition (a)**
       - Adds two numbers.
       - **Example**: 5 + 3 = 8

    2. **Subtraction (s)**
       - Subtracts the second number from the first number.
       - **Example**: 5 - 3 = 2

    3. **Multiplication (m)**
       - Multiplies two numbers.
       - **Example**: 5 * 3 = 15

    4. **Division (d)**
       - Divides the first number by the second number.
       - **Example**: 6 / 3 = 2
       - **Note**: Division by zero is not allowed.

    ### How to Use Basic Operations
    1. Choose the basic calculator by typing 1 when prompted.
    2. Enter the operation (a, s, m, d).
    3. Enter the first number.
    4. Enter the second number.
    5. The result will be displayed.

    ## Advanced Operations
    The advanced calculator supports additional operations:

    1. **Square**
       - Squares a number.
       - **Example**: 4^2 = 16

    2. **Cube**
       - Cubes a number.
       - **Example**: 3^3 = 27

    3. **Power**
       - Raises the first number to the power of the second number.
       - **Example**: 2^3 = 8

    4. **Square Root (sqrt)**
       - Calculates the square root of a number.
       - **Example**: sqrt(16) = 4

    5. **Cube Root (cbrt)**
       - Calculates the cube root of a number.
       - **Example**: cbrt(27) = 3

    6. **Custom Root (root)**
       - Calculates the nth root of a number.
       - **Example**: 8^(1/3) = 2 (cube root)

    ### How to Use Advanced Operations
    1. Choose the advanced calculator by typing 2 when prompted.
    2. Enter the operation (square, cube, power, sqrt, cbrt, root).
    3. Enter the first number (type 0 for square, cube, sqrt, cbrt, or custom root).
    4. Enter the second number.
    5. The result will be displayed.

    ## Trigonometric Functions

       - **Example**: sin(30) = 0.5

    2. **Cosine (cos)**
       - Calculates the cosine of an angle (in degrees).
       - **Example**: cos(60) = 0.5

    3. **Tangent (tan)**
       - Calculates the tangent of an angle (in degrees).
       - **Example**: tan(45) = 1

    ### How to Use Trigonometric Functions
    1. Choose the advanced calculator by typing 2 when prompted.
    2. Enter the operation (sin, cos, tan).
    3. Enter the first number (type 0 for trigonometric functions).
    4. Enter the angle in degrees.
    5. The result will be displayed.

    ## Logarithmic Functions
    The advanced calculator supports logarithmic functions:

    1. **Logarithm (log)**
       - Calculates the base-10 logarithm of a number.
       - **Example**: log(100) = 2

    2. **Natural Logarithm (ln)**
       - Calculates the natural logarithm of a number.
       - **Example**: ln(2.718) â‰ˆ 1

    ### How to Use Logarithmic Functions
    1. Choose the advanced calculator by typing 2 when prompted.
    2. Enter the operation (log, ln).
    3. Enter the first number (type 0 for logarithmic functions).
    4. Enter the number.
    5. The result will be displayed.

    ## Special Math Lessons
    ### Basic Arithmetic
    - **Addition**: Combining two or more quantities.
    - **Subtraction**: Finding the difference between two quantities.
    - **Multiplication**: Repeated addition of the same number.
    - **Division**: Splitting a number into equal parts.

    ### Exponents and Roots
    - **Exponentiation**: Raising a number to a power.
    - **Square Root**: Finding a number that, when multiplied by itself, gives the original number.
    - **Cube Root**: Finding a number that, when cubed, gives the original number.

    ### Trigonometry
    - **Sine, Cosine, Tangent**: Functions that relate the angles of a triangle to the lengths of its sides.

    ### Logarithms
    - **Logarithm**: The exponent by which a base number must be raised to produce a given number.
    - **Natural Logarithm**: Logarithm with base e (Euler's number).
